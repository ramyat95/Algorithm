Geometric Algorithms: 
These algorithms are designed to solve Geometric Problems and solve diverse problems in AI and Machine learning. 
Used in Deep learning and 2D data , also called as convolutional neural networks (CNN).

Geometric Algorithms can be used to:
Classify the data to separate them.
Regression to find best fit line.
Best fit regression line.



Graph Algorithms: 
These algorithms are designed to describe more complex data and relationship between them. 
Used in 3D objects and graph, also called as Graph convolutional networks (GCN).
